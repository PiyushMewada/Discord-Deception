daytime trial pseudocode:
list players in #public-record
	after some time (forcing discussion first):
		dm them to "use ?nominate playernum once you've decided on a suspect to nominate" and link to #public-record for list/discussion
	?vote playernum
	if they're late, they vote for themselves
in public-record, list nominees in order of highest to lowest
	include in brackets who voted from them
	e.g.: 3 votes: billybobjoe
			[wiofwioejioefw, iweffjwefewoij, fwoiwijoe]
[make first to the punch the tie breaker for 4+ way ties]
if 3 way tie:	show suspect a,b,c
else:		show suspect a,b
dm everyone, listing lettered suspects
	?vote playernum
only one revote:
	if second tie, go straight to night
when killed: reveal their role to public-record like you would to a cop
