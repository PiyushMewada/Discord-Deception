NOTE: calling secret game roles "jobs" to make a distinction between discord roles and in-game secret game JOBS 


best rules imo: http://org.ntnu.no/mafia/Game/game.shtml		http://org.ntnu.no/mafia/Rules/rules.shtml
	dead don't talk (duh)
	first night mafia get to know each other but don't kill, but cop still gets to investigate
	game ends when all normal innocents die or all mafia die
	voting is public and simultaneous
		maybe DM them and then the bot displays all the votes after
	daytime deaths reveal identity, night deaths do not

tie votes:
	the rules above handle it by requiring the game to have an odd number of players
		every daytime vote is then with an odd number of players
	idea: if even number of players, mafia gets to kill someone at night. if odd, they don't.


MODIFICATION: create evil-lair everytime it's time at nighttime, and delete it when it isn't time
	this way, we don't have to worry about modifying privileges
	tell mafia to go to evil-lair when it's their time
	(same with police-station)

?mafia triggers mafiaSetUp, which collects a show of hands of who wants to play
?ready (if used by the host) looks up which game is being played and runs that game's script



?mafia command plan:
	[note: extensive rule explanation before each phase, requesting thumbs up from everybody before it starts and timer begins]
	[note: log all win/loss data, including starting players/roles, who was left, and which team won]
	[note: maybe have defaults, but some settings changes the host can control, like if the dead reveal their roles]
	`- poll "Like this comment if you wanna play." and show the role ratio for the current number (bolded), one more, and one less
	`- reply to the host "type ?ready when everyone has joined."
	`- on ?ready, set all players to the 'Citizen #' Role, each assigned a number (or not?)
	`- create "Mafia Game" CategoryChannel
		only the 'Citizen' Role can be in it, using PermissionOverwrites
	`- create "Town Hall" voice channel
		`userLimit = number of players
	`- create "public record" text channel
	- create "evil lair" text channel
		only mafia are allowed to talk in here, *** and ONLY during killing phase at night (change permissions each nighttime)
	- create "police station" text channel
		same boat, only police, and only during their specific time at night
	- "All of you have been DMed your secret roles. Like this message to confirm you've received yours. Night will start when everyone has liked this comment."
		make a ring (maybe mute everyone) and shortened text to speech announcement in the voice chat mentioning the message 
			maybe do this for all bot messages
	- Night phase:
		- everyone is muted and video is turned off
		- mafia use ?kill @player command in evil lair to decide who to kill only once (have a countdown timer for who they kill, or nobody is killed. make sure the person they try to kill isn't already dead.) then they're kicked
		- police use ?investigate @player (or ?inspect maybe) only once, and bot tells their secret role
		- doctor uses ?protect @player only once
	- Morning phase:
		- everyone is unmuted and video is turned back on (they wake up)
		- funny story is told about how the victim died (and maybe rescued; that's where the suspense comes in) in the text channel
		- if they die, their identity is revealed (or not?) and they're immediately kicked from the CategoryChannel, with the userLimit-- for the voice channel
	- Daytime Trial phase:
		- to be put on trial, a person needs to recieve ?accuse ?second ?third @player by 3 different people
			- maybe show tracker for each person being accused, seconded, thirded somehow, maybe an updating comment that stays at the bottom of the chat at all times
			- no more than one trial per daytime
			- if nobody is put on trial, it jumps to nighttime without a trial
				wait until things die down before timer starts (nobody accuses/seconds/thirds in, say, 1 minute, w more time at start)
		- accuser is put on trial with the accused. accuser gets 30s to say why he should die (everyone else muted). accused gets 30s to defend.
		- simultaneous vote whether to hang accuser
			- if he dies, same situation as if killed by mafia
		- if he lives, accuser gives 30s defense of themself, then simultaneous bote whether to hang them
		(alternate rules: 2 people get accused and one of those two people must die)
	- Game ends if:
		-all mafia die (innocent win)
		-3 people are left and 1 is mafia (mafia win)
